DaemonPID
==========

DaemonPID is a NodeJS utility module which provides straight-forward and robust PID file management; perfect for writing and reading PID files for daemonized services. It provides the ability to check or monitor the status of previously launched child processes, store additional data along with the process id, and provides process start-time verification to ensure the recorded process-id was not recycled by the OS.

## What is a PID file?

A PID file is essentially a text file in a well-defined location in the 
file-system which contains at-least the process ID of a running application. 
Writing PID files is a convention used in many software systems as a simple 
way to check the status of services or daemonized processes without requiring 
separate supervisory or monitoring processes.




## PID File Pitfalls 

Process IDs are not required to be unique and can potentially be recycled. To solve this issue, DaemonPID also records and checks the start-time of the process for future comparison and status checks.




## Basic Usage

Here's a basic use-case of DaemonPID in a daemonized process.

### Inside Child Process

    pid = require('daemon-pid')(PID_FILE_PATH);
    
    // writes-out the pid file
    pid.write(function(err) {
        // err indicates error writing pid file
    });
    
    // on SIGTERM delete the pid file
    process.on('SIGTERM', function() {
      pid.delete(function(err) {
        if (err) console.error('Something we wrong deleting the pid file!');
      });
    });

### Inside Launch Script or CLI

    pid = require('daemon-pid')(PID_FILE_PATH);
    spawn = require('child_process').spawn;
    
    child = spawn('node', [SERVICE_FILE], {
        detached: true,
        stdio: ['ignore']
    });
    
    // remove the pid file on exit
    child.on('close', function(code) {
        pid.delete(function(err) {
            // err indicates error deleting pid file
        });
    });

### Status Checking Script or CLI

    pid = require('daemon-pid')(PID_FILE_PATH);
    
    pid.running(function(err, running) {
        if (running) {
            console.log('service is running as expected');
        } else {
            console.error('service is down!');
        }
    });




## Advanced Usage
    
### Storing Data

Additional information can be stored in the PID file for use later. Any data convertible to JSON can be stored.

    pid = require('daemon-pid')(PID_FILE_PATH);
    
    // writes-out the pid file with additional data
    pid.write(function(err) {
        // err indicates error writing pid file
    }, SERVICE_PORT_NUMBER);

In another script that data can later be retreived:

    pid = require('daemon-pid')(PID_FILE_PATH);
    
    // writes-out the pid file with additional data
    pid.read(function(err, port) {
        if (err) {
            console.error('unable to read pid file');
        } else {
            console.log('service running on port ' + port);
        }
    });

### Simple Status Monitor

It's easy to implement a simple status-monitor as a separate process.

    pid = require('daemon-pid')(PID_FILE_PATH);
    
    pid.monitor(function(err) {
        if (err) {
            console.error('unable to read pid file');
        } else {
            console.error('service went down!');
        }
    });


## Examples

Currently, there's a single example in `examples/`. 

(Examples are not included in the npm package. Please download or clone the repo at [https://github.com/JoshuaToenyes/daemon-pid](https://github.com/JoshuaToenyes/daemon-pid) for the example files.)

### Basic Use Case Example

The basic example offers a very simple CLI in `cli.js` and the canonical "Hello World" web server as a service to be daemonized (in `server.js`). Just `cd` into that directory and run `node cli.js start` to start the server, `node cli.js stop` to stop it, and `node cli.js status` to see the current status of the server process.


## API

### write(callback, data)

Creates the PID file and writes it to the filesystem.

#### Arguments

- `callback(err)` - Called when the write is complete with a possible error.
- `data` - Additional (JSON-able) data to store.

-------------

### read(callback)

Reads the PID file from the filesystem.

#### Arguments

- `callback(err, data)` - Called with possible error and data stored using `write()`.

-------------

### delete(callback)

Deletes the associated pid file.

#### Arguments

- `callback(err)` - Called with possible error.

-------------

### running(callback)

Checks if the associated process is currently running.

#### Arguments

- `callback(err, running, data)` - Called with possible error, boolean `running` indicating if the process is running and additionally the `data` stored in the pid file using `write()`.

-------------

### uptime(callback)

Retrieves the time in seconds the process referenced by the pid file has been running.

#### Arguments

- `callback(err, seconds)` - Called with possible error and process uptime in seconds.

-------------

### started(callback)

Retrieves a `Date` object representing the date and time the process referenced by the pid file was started.
 
#### Arguments

- `callback(err, date)` - Called with possible error and the date/time the process was started.

-------------

### kill(signal, callback)

Sends the passed signal to the process (basically a shortcut for process.kill).

#### Arguments

- `signal` - The signal to send, 'SIGTERM', 'SIGKILL', etc.
- `callback(err)` - Called if an error occurred with passing the signal, or if the process is not running.

-------------

### pid(callback)

Retrieves the process-id of the referenced process.

#### Arguments

- `callback(err, pid)` - Callback passed a possible error and the pid of the running process. An error pass if the process is not running.

-------------

### monitor(callback, interval = 5000)

Creates a monitoring interval which periodically (every five seconds by default) checks that the associated process is still running. If it stops, for any reason, or it cannot access the pid file, the `callback` function is called.

#### Arguments

- `callback(err)` - Called if the process stops or an error occurs accessing the pid file. If `err` is undefined, then no error occurred and the process is not running (see example above).

-------------

### stop()

Stops monitoring the associated process.
